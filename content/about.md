## Me {#me}

I'm just your average, everyday, regular software developer with too many things on his mind. <br/>
Oh, and I love Emacs, but you'll find that out as you read through my posts. <br/>

I am currently employed at [TomTom](https://www.tomtom.com/) as a Senior Software engineer, a great environment where I've had many opportunities to grow and learn over the years. <br/>

_All of the opinions voiced on this website are my own._ <br/>


## My work {#my-work}

I am not extremely active in the Open Source community, for a lack of time and motivation. <br/>

This blog is an attempt to give back bits and pieces of knowledge that I have gathered over many years, while also motivating myself to do more in this space. <br/>

Some minor things I have(n't) been working on are: <br/>

-   [newsa.gent](https://github.com/detvdl/newsa.gent) -- the source of this blog. Provides a sneak peek into draft/unpublished content, without the need for a Patreon subscription! <br/>
-   [cue-mode.el](https://github.com/detvdl/cue-mode.el) -- a minimal Emacs major mode for the [CUE configuration language](https://cuelang.org/) <br/>
-   [emacs.d](https://github.com/detvdl/emacs.d) -- my personal Emacs configuration. Caution: very scuffed and prone to mishaps! <br/>

Those, and any other unfinished projects you can find over at my [GitHub profile](https://github.com/detvdl). <br/>
